That’s a great idea! Creating a comprehensive tracking and teaching plan for your children’s learning will help maintain structure and ensure they cover all the necessary skills.

I’ll outline a **bi-weekly plan** for the following subjects:

1. **English Language and Literacy**
2. **Science**
3. **Social Studies**
4. **Art and Creativity**
5. **Life Skills**

After this, I will also prepare an **Excel document** with separate tabs for each subject, making it easy for you to track their progress.

### Additional Notes:

* **Weekly Review**: At the end of each two-week block, make sure to review the concepts and do a small quiz or practice test to gauge understanding.
* **Hands-on Activities**: Encourage real-world applications (e.g., measuring items at home, budgeting, drawing shapes) to make the learning process engaging.
